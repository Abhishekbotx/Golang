	// this is polymorphism in action

	// explaination:
	// The makePayment method on the payment struct calls the pay method on its gateway field.
	// Since gateway is of the interface type paymentBank, it can hold any concrete implementation
	// (like stripe, razorpay, paypal) that implements the pay method.
	// When(razorpay,stripe ,etc) makePayment is called, it invokes the pay method of the specific gateway implementation
	// that was assigned to the gateway field, demonstrating polymorphism.
